Duality

Imported from http://code.google.com/p/duality

Duality is a plugin-based 2d game authoring framework. To get a quick overview, please visit the project page. The framework can be conceptually divided into three parts:

The Engine / "Duality": A component-based game engine, backbone of the overall package. Features the use of dynamically loaded core plugins extending its functionality.

The Editor / "Dualitor": A WYSIWYG editor to prototype, test and develop content for the engine in general or targeting an actual game. Features the use of dynamically loaded editor plugins extending its functionality and supporting specific core plugins.

The Launcher: A single executable file that utilizes the engine to load and execute a game (content package) created with the editor.

Besides the google code project overview and documentation, there is also a developer blog. If you want to contribute to the project, be it by active development, documentation or testing, just contact me. The same applies to any questions or suggestions - feedback is always welcome! However, bugs and feature requests should be files in the issue tracking system.
