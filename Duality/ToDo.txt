	-->	Stuff
	-->	Also, define a new GameObjectFromMaterial converter that implements
		a special case for materials using lighting techniques. We should create a
		LightingSpriteRenderer here, not a SpriteRenderer.


--> Example Project: Tetris with Physics
	-->	Need Joints for this in order to create partially destructible blocks


--> Physics Thoughts
	-->	What about Joints?
		-->	Any Collider can be attached to the world or any other Collider using Joints.
			This is NOT a scene-hierarchial thing.
		-->	Handle joints as some kind of property of a Collider, since any Joint will be
			attached to at least one Collider.
		-->	WYSIWYG-Editor for those joints as well when CamView in Collider edit mode.
		-->	Complex physical objects can be composed out of several parented GameObjects.
			They can also be done using custom Components, but likely won't.
	-->	How would you do.. (All those should be possible in some way!)
		-->	.. a platformer with moving platforms?

		-->	.. a complex character / ragdoll?
		-->	.. a complex vehicle (tank, walker, etc.)
		-->	.. a hanging bridge, rope, etc?






-->	Isometric perspective: How to implement for a game?
	-->	Should actually use the Z Component, but apply it other than currently
	-->	Maybe just utilize PreprocessCoords to add Z to Y?
		-->	Will that work in all cases? Editor? Canvas? Any Renderer?

-->	Keep in mind: Saving GameObjects with PrefabLinks is currently highly data-redundant.
	-->	When in ExecutionContext.Editor, consider not saving Components that are part of the Prefab.
	-->	Can't do the same with GameObjects though, because their index is used to locate them when applying
		the PrefabLink. Changing the order or removing existing GameObjects requires extra consideration.


############### HOWTO: Obtain the Z-Pos of a rendered pixel relative to the Camera ###############

//Vector3 screenPos = new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.0f);
//GL.ReadPixels(this.pickingTex.PxWidth / 2, this.pickingTex.PxHeight / 2, 1, 1, PixelFormat.DepthComponent, PixelType.Float, ref screenPos.Z);
//screenPos -= Vector3.One * 0.5f;
//screenPos *= 2.0f;
//Matrix4 matTemp = this.matFinal;
//matTemp.Invert();
//Vector3.Transform(ref screenPos, ref matTemp, out screenPos);
//Log.Editor.Write("{0:F},\t{1:F},\t{2:F}", screenPos.X, screenPos.Y, screenPos.Z);
