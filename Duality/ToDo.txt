	-->	Wrong picking on DropDownMenus - Is there a workaround for propert Item-Hover help topics?
		-->	"Capture" help focus on opening the menu?
		-->	Would need capturing functionality in IHelpProvider
		
	-->	When F1 is pressed, the current help topic is opened up in the Duality doc ".chm" file, if applicable.
	-->	Decide what to do in IHelpProvider, provide extension method for default behaviour.

	-->	Help Topic: Hovering an Enum- or FlagEnumPropertyEditor's enum field (?)

-->	Possible schedule:
	1.	Implement sandbox mode for editor
	2.	Implement physics & use sandbox for testing

-->	Duality Tasks (overall)
	-->	Editor Sandbox (Play | Pause | Reset)
	-->	Physics & Collision Detection
	-->	Particle Systems & Particle Editor
	-->	Ingame GUI & GUI Editor
	-->	(Property) Animations & Animation Editor

-->	Editor Sandbox:
	-->	Play:	Switch Duality's execution context and caus the editor to mimic the
				launchers behaviour, i.e. perform actual updates, etc.
				Right before doing that, make a temporary backup of the current Scene.
	-->	Pause:	Switches back to editor context & behaviour (only EditorUpdate, not Update, etc.)
	-->	Reset:	Switch back to editor behaviour and load Scene backup.

	-->	When in sandbox mode, disable the save scene button. The current Scene is temporary.
	-->	Also be sure to adjust the ObjectInspector to update itsself periodically when in sandbox mode.
	-->	The same applies for any visible CamView. Render yourself periodically!
	-->	The SceneView should keep itsself up-to-date already, because it's hooked in Scene events.




-->	Keep in mind: Saving GameObjects with PrefabLinks is currently highly data-redundant.
	-->	When in ExecutionContext.Editor, consider not saving Components that are part of the Prefab.
	-->	Can't do the same with GameObjects though, because their index is used to locate them when applying
		the PrefabLink. Changing the order or removing existing GameObjects requires extra consideration.
