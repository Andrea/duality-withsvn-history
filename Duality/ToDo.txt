
-->	While being at Serialization: !!! FINALLY FIX THAT: !!!
	-->	Keep in mind: While reloading Core plugins at runtime does work fine in most cases, it might result in
		undefined behaviour when custom Resource types have been modified, as only Prefabs and the current level
		are reloaded.
		-->	Possible solution: Scan the reloaded core plugin for classes deriving from Resource, and clear all
			Resources matching their Type as well.

-->	Keep in mind: Saving GameObjects with PrefabLinks is currently highly data-redundant.
	-->	When in ExecutionContext.Editor, consider not saving Components that are part of the Prefab.
	-->	Can't do the same with GameObjects though, because their index is used to locate them when applying
		the PrefabLink. Changing the order or removing existing GameObjects requires extra consideration.
