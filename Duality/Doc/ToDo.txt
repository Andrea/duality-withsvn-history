
-->	Implement specialized Component PropertyEditors
	-->	SpriteRenderer
		-->	ContentRef<T> editor - does not allow editing the resources, but has dragdrop support and
			can highlight the currently used resource in the ProjectFolderView
		-->	BatchInfo / Material editor
			-->	Dictionary<T,U> editor 
				-->	Maybe some KeyValuePair-like vertical subeditor duo and ICollection layout?
				-->	Not quite. Freely editing existing keys only leads to problems
				-->	Don't allow it. Allow to create and delete KeyValuePairs, and to edit the values, but not the keys.
				-->	Use ICollection layout with ToString()'d key as PropertyName for the listed PropertyEditors
				-->	Creating a new pair: Use usually hidden dumy PropertyEditor at the end of the list

-->	Approach next step: Run Game in Launcher
	-->	Test Camera setup & object velocity stuff

-->	Editor Skeletton
	-->	Sandbox (Play | Pause | Reset)
	-->	Plugin / VS integration
