
-->	Formatted text
	-->	Provide element measurement
	-->	Provide element picking
	-->	Features yet to support:
		-->	WordWrap / MaxWidth / MaxHeight, optionally cropping the actual text to fit
			-->	Keep an eye on PeekLineStats, it currently reacts only to newline elements
			-->	How to split TextElements anyway..?
			-->	Probably need API enhancements for that
		-->	Horizontal text alignment

-->	Rendering Text? Ingame? How to?
	-->	Provide a TextRenderer Component?
	-->	There needs to be a more general way. Figure something out.
		-->	Text can be a subset of vertices of any renderer
		-->	Text can also be stand-alone via Component
		-->	Text can be formatted
		-->	Provide a general method to emit vertex data based on a formatted text and additional params?


-->	Figure out suitable RenderScreenOverlay-like system
	-->	Goal: Rendering screen overlay that bypasses 
		picking, camera rotation and center-aligned screen coordinates
	-->	Use ICmpScreenOverlayRenderer interface instead of extending Renderer class?
		-->	Pro: Great for debugging
		-->	Pro: Doesn't really need Renderer stuff (bounding radius, etc.. )
			because it is always visible, independent from camera transform, etc.


-->	Checklist for first Game: Asteroids
	-->	Any Usability stuff that comes up while editing / creating the game

	-->	Title Scene
	-->	Game Scene (No levels, dynamically creates stages)
	-->	Highscore Scene


-->	Usability
	-->	If a SpriteRenderer is attached a Material, consider auto-updating the Rect
	-->	Non-Parallax objects shouldn't be pickable in a parallax CamView
		-->	Selective picking / picking predicate
	-->	Is it possible to recover from deleting classes in a plugin that are still used?
	-->	Find some generalized, Plugin-friendly interface for defining such special behaviour:
		-->	Dragdrop Material to SpriteRenderer: Set SharedMaterial
		-->	Dragdrop Material to GameObject (both CamView & SceneView): If it has a SpriteRenderer, set SharedMaterial
