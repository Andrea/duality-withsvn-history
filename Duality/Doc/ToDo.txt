
-->	Checklist for first Game: Asteroids

	-->	Sound! Create a flexible, OpenAL-based sound system for Duality
		-->	BudgetPad features
		-->	SoundEmitter Component type. For placing loop sounds in the level and having an
			easy way to play sound effect without always having to create a custom Component
			invoking the SoundManagers PlaySound methods
			-->	Should be able to maintain multiple sounds at once?
			-->	Keep in mind what Nullpunkt needed for space ships: Multiple (loop) sounds
				attached to a single object, each with their own offset, volume, etc.
		-->	SoundEmitterPropertyEditor & Testing in editor
			(Careful: SoundListener always needs to be at the currently active CamView cam)

	-->	Any Usability stuff that comes up while editing / creating the game

	-->	Title Scene
	-->	Game Scene (No levels, dynamically creates stages)
	-->	Highscore Scene


-->	Usability
	-->	If a SpriteRenderer is attached a Material, consider auto-updating the Rect
	-->	Non-Parallax objects shouldn't be pickable in a parallax CamView
		-->	Selective picking / picking predicate
	-->	Is it possible to recover from deleting classes in a plugin that are still used?
	-->	Find some generalized, Plugin-friendly interface for defining such special behaviour:
		-->	Dragdrop Material to SpriteRenderer: Set SharedMaterial
		-->	Dragdrop Material to GameObject (both CamView & SceneView): If it has a SpriteRenderer, set SharedMaterial

-->	Editor Skeletton
	-->	Sandbox (Play | Pause | Reset)
