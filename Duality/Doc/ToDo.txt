
-->	Component PropertyEditors
	-->	Create a general "ComponentPropertyEditor", similar to the "MemberwisePropertyEditor"
	-->	Differences:
		-->	Has an Icon and allows direct access to the Active-Checkbox
		-->	Doesn't display "Component [..] Component in GameObj", not necessary here,
			title area isn't split here at all
		-->	Doesn't auto-generate sub-editors, but still provides utility methods for
			creating generic Getter / Setter funcs for properties / fields
		-->	Fires editor events
		-->	No Reset / Init button
		-->	Probably optional context menu button instead at that position
	-->	Derives from GroupedPropertyEditor
	-->	To achieve some of the differnces, extend the GroupedPropertyEditors header class
		to be more flexible / customizable
	-->	Previously existing "memberwise" ComponentPropertyEditor not needed anymore

-->	Implement specialized Component PropertyEditors
	-->	Transform
	-->	SpriteRenderer
	-->	..

-->	Core Plugin Reloading needs to be updated according to Scene management
	-->	Save-to-temporary-Scene-then-Reload breaks Scene.Current.
	-->	Figure something out to prevent that.
