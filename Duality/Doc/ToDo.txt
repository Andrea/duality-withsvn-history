
-->	Approach next step: Run Game in Launcher
	-->	Test Camera setup & object velocity stuff

-->	Usability
	-->	TexturePropertyEditor that automatically reloads the Texture if needed (e.g. if the Pixmap base path changed)
	-->	Find some generalized, Plugin-friendly interface for defining such special behaviour:
		-->	Pixmap context menu in ProjectFolderView: Create Texture.
			-->	Same for Rightclick-DragDrop of a Pixmap somewhere else
		-->	Dragdrop Material to SpriteRenderer: Set SharedMaterial
		-->	Dragdrop Material to GameObject (both CamView & SceneView): If it has a SpriteRenderer, set SharedMaterial

-->	Editor Skeletton
	-->	Sandbox (Play | Pause | Reset)
	-->	Plugin / VS integration
