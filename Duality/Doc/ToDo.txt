
-->	Checklist for first Game: Asteroids
	-->	Proper SpriteRenderer
		-->	Support for animated Textures
			-->	Textures may contain an index-based atlas map.
			-->	For animated or multi-textures, simply autogenerate it,
				one index for each animation frame
			-->	SpriteRenderer may animate inbetween any index range and at
				any given speed (duration for the whole animation to complete)
			-->	It may optionally smoothly fade between two animation steps by
				internally drawing two rects, each with its own alpha value
				-->	Sadly, requires TWO custom material infos for EACH SpriteRenderer

	-->	Any Usability stuff that comes up while editing / creating the game

	-->	Title Scene
	-->	Game Scene (No levels, dynamically creates stages)
	-->	Highscore Scene


-->	Usability
	-->	If a SpriteRenderer is attached a Material, consider auto-updating the Rect
	-->	Non-Parallax objects shouldn't be pickable in a parallax CamView
		-->	Selective picking / picking predicate
	-->	Is it possible to recover from deleting classes in a plugin that are still used?
	-->	Find some generalized, Plugin-friendly interface for defining such special behaviour:
		-->	Dragdrop Material to SpriteRenderer: Set SharedMaterial
		-->	Dragdrop Material to GameObject (both CamView & SceneView): If it has a SpriteRenderer, set SharedMaterial

-->	Editor Skeletton
	-->	Sandbox (Play | Pause | Reset)
