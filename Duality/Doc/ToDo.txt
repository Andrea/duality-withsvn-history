	-->	Camera
		-->	Rect editor
		-->	Vector3 / Vector2 editor
		-->	IColorData editor with preview, dragdrop and color picker dialog
		-->	BitMask editor
	-->	SpriteRenderer
		-->	ContentRef<T> editor - does not allow editing the resources, but has dragdrop support and
			can highlight the currently used resource in the ProjectFolderView
		-->	BatchInfo / Material editor
			-->	Dictionary<T,U> editor (maybe some keyvaluepair-like vertical subeditor duo and ICollection layout?)

-->	Approach next step: Run Game in Launcher
	-->	Test Camera setup & object velocity stuff

-->	Editor Skeletton
	-->	Sandbox (Play | Pause | Reset)
