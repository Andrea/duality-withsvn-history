
-->	Checklist for first Game: Asteroids
	-->	Sound! Create a flexible, OpenAL-based sound system for Duality
		-->	Both 2D and 3D
			-->	2D are global, subset of them: budget-based audio pads (music, environment, ...)
			-->	3D are local, require a position in space. Optional: GameObject reference
				as parent object, treating own position as offset.
			-->	SoundListener Component type. Unlike in Unity, there can be more than 1 (Splitscreen!)
			-->	SoundEmitter Component type. For placing loop sounds in the level and having an
				easy way to play sound effect without always having to create a custom Component
				invoking the SoundManagers PlaySound methods
		-->	Global sound manager (DualityApp.Sound), sounds are played by calling methods there,
			returns reference to a sound instance
		-->	Sound Resources
			-->	AudioData : Resource	-->	Wraps up OggVorbis compressed data
			-->	Sound : Resource		-->	References AudioData, holds attributes
		-->	Streaming support for pads / music / unique sounds, streaming directly from memory
	-->	Any Usability stuff that comes up while editing / creating the game

	-->	Title Scene
	-->	Game Scene (No levels, dynamically creates stages)
	-->	Highscore Scene


-->	Usability
	-->	If a SpriteRenderer is attached a Material, consider auto-updating the Rect
	-->	Non-Parallax objects shouldn't be pickable in a parallax CamView
		-->	Selective picking / picking predicate
	-->	Is it possible to recover from deleting classes in a plugin that are still used?
	-->	Find some generalized, Plugin-friendly interface for defining such special behaviour:
		-->	Dragdrop Material to SpriteRenderer: Set SharedMaterial
		-->	Dragdrop Material to GameObject (both CamView & SceneView): If it has a SpriteRenderer, set SharedMaterial

-->	Editor Skeletton
	-->	Sandbox (Play | Pause | Reset)
