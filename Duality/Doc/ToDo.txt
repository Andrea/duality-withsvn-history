			-->	In addition to its member editors, directly parent each sound Sources editor
				onto the SoundEmitter
			-->	Create via dragdrop, Delete via button at Source editor
			-->	Create a custom editor

	-->	Any Usability stuff that comes up while editing / creating the game

	-->	Title Scene

-->	Usability
	-->	If a SpriteRenderer is attached a Material, consider auto-updating the Rect
	-->	Non-Parallax objects shouldn't be pickable in a parallax CamView
		-->	Selective picking / picking predicate
	-->	Is it possible to recover from deleting classes in a plugin that are still used?
	-->	Find some generalized, Plugin-friendly interface for defining such special behaviour:
		-->	Dragdrop Material to SpriteRenderer: Set SharedMaterial
		-->	Dragdrop Material to GameObject (both CamView & SceneView): If it has a SpriteRenderer, set SharedMaterial
