	-->	Display something, ToDo stuff
	-->	Features to support:
		-->	Colored Text
		-->	Multiple Fonts
		-->	Icon insertion (treated as glyphs)
		-->	WordWrap / Multiline
		-->	MaxWidth / MaxHeight, optionally cropping the actual text to fit

-->	Rendering Text? Ingame? How to?
	-->	Provide a TextRenderer Component?
	-->	There needs to be a more general way. Figure something out.
		-->	Text can be a subset of vertices of any renderer
		-->	Text can also be stand-alone via Component
		-->	Text can be formatted
		-->	Provide a general method to emit vertex data based on a formatted text and additional params?

	-->	Any Usability stuff that comes up while editing / creating the game

	-->	Title Scene
	-->	Game Scene (No levels, dynamically creates stages)
	-->	Highscore Scene


-->	Usability
	-->	If a SpriteRenderer is attached a Material, consider auto-updating the Rect
	-->	Non-Parallax objects shouldn't be pickable in a parallax CamView
		-->	Selective picking / picking predicate
	-->	Is it possible to recover from deleting classes in a plugin that are still used?
	-->	Find some generalized, Plugin-friendly interface for defining such special behaviour:
		-->	Dragdrop Material to SpriteRenderer: Set SharedMaterial
		-->	Dragdrop Material to GameObject (both CamView & SceneView): If it has a SpriteRenderer, set SharedMaterial
