
-->	Test the postprocessing system
	4.	Multiple bounces (3 or more stages)
		-->	Maybe apply the previously used shader multiple times?
		-->	Maybe try some simple blur?
	5.	Split Rendering (2 stages)
		-->	Render color data to multiple textures at once (Multi-RenderTarget)
			while splitting up the information
		-->	Render to screen and put together all information using a shader
		-->	With and without multisampling

	-->	Title Scene
	-->	Game Scene (No levels, dynamically creates stages)
	-->	Highscore Scene


-->	Usability
	-->	If a SpriteRenderer is attached a Material, consider auto-updating the Rect
	-->	Non-Parallax objects shouldn't be pickable in a parallax CamView
		-->	Selective picking / picking predicate
	-->	Is it possible to recover from deleting classes in a plugin that are still used?
	-->	Find some generalized, Plugin-friendly interface for defining such special behaviour:
		-->	Dragdrop Material to SpriteRenderer: Set SharedMaterial
		-->	Dragdrop Material to GameObject (both CamView & SceneView): If it has a SpriteRenderer, set SharedMaterial
